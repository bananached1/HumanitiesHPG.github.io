        <h1>An Introduction</h1>
        <p>The Tokugawa Shogunate was the military government that ruled Japan during the Edo period. It lasted until the end of the Edo era in 1868, when the Japanese Empire was established. Following years of civil war after the collapse of the previous shogunate in 1573, Tokugawa Lensayu managed to unify the powerful Daimyo feudal lords and emerged victorious, establishing the Tokugawa Shogunate based in the city of Edo (modern-day Tokyo).</p>

          <h1>The Edo period</h1>
          <p>The Edo period, also known as the Tokugawa period, was a significant era in Japanese history spanning from 1603 to 1868. This period was marked by unprecedented peace, stability, and isolationism under the rule of the Tokugawa shogunate. Named after the Tokugawa family, who established their seat of power in Edo (modern-day Tokyo), the period saw a centralized feudal government exerting control over the country. One of the defining characteristics of the Edo period was the implementation of strict social hierarchy and the rigid caste system. The society was divided into four main classes: samurai, farmers, artisans, and merchants, with each class having its own set of privileges and restrictions. Despite the hierarchical structure, the period also witnessed the rise of a vibrant urban culture, with Edo emerging as one of the largest cities in the world, bustling with economic activity and cultural exchange.</p>

      <h1>The role of the Samurai</h1>
      <p>A Samurai is a role renowned in Japan and across the globe. The role of the samurai was initially a high ranking military role, designed to be called upon in times of national emergency. Essentially a Japanese version of a mediaeval knight. The Tokugawa Shogunate oversaw the Edo era, which saw great economic growth and urbanisation, but also was one of the most peaceful times in Japanese history, with the Shogunate pursuing an isolationist policy that shaped much of its time in power. This however meant that the role of the Samurai had to evolve, as there were no longer wars to fight. Many became part of the ruling class, and some even became Daimyos (wealthy landowners) themselves.</p>
